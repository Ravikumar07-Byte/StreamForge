# StreamForge

## Day 0 — Project Initialization

### Overview

Day 0 marks the starting point of the **StreamForge** project. The repository was initialized with the basic project structure and development environment required to begin building the real-time truck telemetry streaming system.

At this stage, the `README.md` file was still empty, and the repository contained the initial project folders and configuration files.

### Day 0 Objectives

* Initialize the StreamForge repository.
* Establish the basic project directory structure.
* Prepare the Python development environment.
* Add the initial dependency configuration.
* Add environment configuration template.
* Add Git ignore configuration.
* Prepare directories for backend, frontend, data, documentation, scripts, state management, and testing.
* Initialize the project under Git version control.

### Initial Technology Direction

The project structure was prepared for a system involving:

* Python backend development
* Kafka-based event streaming
* Docker-based infrastructure
* Automated testing
* Frontend integration
* Configuration management
* Data and state management

### Day 0 Result

The StreamForge repository and development foundation were established successfully. The project was ready to move into the next stage: **Kafka infrastructure setup and backend implementation**.

---

## Day 1 — Backend: Local Kafka Infrastructure

### Overview

Day 1 focused on establishing the **backend messaging infrastructure** for StreamForge.

The backend uses Apache Kafka as the event-streaming layer. Kafka was configured locally with Docker Compose, and the `truck-telemetry` topic was created as the communication channel for truck telemetry events.

### Backend Objectives

* Set up Apache Kafka locally using Docker.
* Configure Kafka as a single-node broker.
* Expose Kafka on port `9092`.
* Create the `truck-telemetry` topic.
* Configure the topic with four partitions.
* Verify that the Kafka broker is running correctly.
* Verify Kafka connectivity from the local development environment.
* Verify the Kafka topic configuration.

### Backend Components Completed

* Docker-based Kafka broker
* Kafka connection on `localhost:9092`
* `truck-telemetry` Kafka topic
* Four Kafka partitions
* Local Kafka connectivity verification
* Topic configuration verification

### Docker Compose

Apache Kafka was configured to run locally through Docker Compose.

Kafka was started using:

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

The running container was verified using:

```powershell
docker compose ps
```

The Kafka service was available as:

```text
streamforge-kafka
```

### Kafka Connectivity

Kafka connectivity was verified using:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection localhost -Port 9092
```

The connection was successfully established:

```text
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

This confirmed that the Kafka broker was accessible through:

```text
localhost:9092
```

### Telemetry Topic

The dedicated Kafka topic for truck telemetry was created:

```text
truck-telemetry
```

The topic was configured with four partitions:

```text
Partition 0
Partition 1
Partition 2
Partition 3
```

The topic configuration was verified using:

```powershell
docker exec streamforge-kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic truck-telemetry --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```
